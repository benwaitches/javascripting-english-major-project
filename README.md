Hello, my name is Ben Waitches-Eubanks, and this is my first time learning programming of any kind. While I'm not completely sure what my goals for this project are, I hope to have a solid entry-level knowledge of these programs I have just installed, and be able to communicate my ideas through the programs effectively.
