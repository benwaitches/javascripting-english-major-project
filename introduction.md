## Introduction

Welcome to my website devoted to tracking the main character Julius through [Teju Cole's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teju_Cole) novel _Open City_. The website features two maps, one of New York City, and one of Brussels, Belgium. Click on a location to view it, and then click on its corresponding tab below the maps to learn how that place informs Julius’ character. Each location has a “sister” location in the other city, explore both maps to discover each one!

While _Open City_ follows Julius mainly through New York City, this website will mainly focus on his vacation to Brussels. Julius visits Brussels not only the use up his saved vacation time, but also because he secretly hopes to find his grandmother there. However, Brussels and New York City are polar opposites, and the reader learns more about Julius’ character as he navigates the strange landscape of Brussels.
