## John F. Kennedy Airport

[John F. Kennedy Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport) is ranked 16th in passenger traffic per year, making it one of the busiest airports in the world.[^1] Compared to the Brussels airport, JFK is a madhouse, and Julius is fully aware of this as he begins his journey to Europe.

One of the only documentations of Julius’ experience in JFK is his own description of his reaction to the problems he sees within the airport. He notes that he had to work on “confronting the disorder of holiday crowds, and controlling [his] anger at the inept boarding agents at Terminal Three” (87). His limited reference to the airport only conveys his displeasure with another aspect of the city. It is only after he leaves the airport and enters his flight that he meets Dr. Maillotte and learns more about the city of Brussels.

The airports in this novel are extremely important to Julius’ character, as they bridge these two cities together, not only physically, but characteristically as well. Dr. Maillotte has lived in both Brussels and New York, and offers a connection between the places through her character. Additionally, both Dr. Maillotte and Mayken force Julius to examine the cities in a new light, a perspective he would not have received had he not visited these airports. Does Julius leave these experiences solely learning about the systematic racism in Brussels, or does he learn more about discrimination in New York City as well?
