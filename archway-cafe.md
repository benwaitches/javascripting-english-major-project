## Archway Cafe

When Julius enters the Cafe in Grand Sablon, he is “one of only two customers” in the entire shop (108). While he is there during the holiday season, it could be challenging to find a cafe in a nice area of New York City with only one customer in it. However, on possible comparison could be the Archway Cafe in the [Dumbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbo,_Brooklyn) neighborhood of Brooklyn.[^1]

Over the last 30 years, Dumbo was purchased by a developing company and underwent the process of gentrification. The result was an upscale neighborhood home to many residencies, stores, and several tourist attractions, much like Grand Sablon.[^2] Additionally, during the holidays after lunch hour, the cafe might be fairly empty and give Julius a similar experience to the one he faces in Grand Sablon.

However, given the nature of New York City and Julius’ differing character in New York City, his experience at the Archway might be quite different. Since New York City citizens have a reputation for being more standoffish and dedicated to their work, the waitress might not have approached Julius and asked where he was from. Subsequently, Julius may not have felt comfortable enough to talk with the complete stranger outside and then sleep with her. For the rest of the novel, Julius does not sleep with another woman, Brussels is the only city where he manages to have sex.

The difference between his experience in Brussels compared to the rest of the novel raises the same questions. Has New York City conditioned Julius to be so reserved, or is his introversion simply a function of his personality? He is able to reach out to a complete stranger on the street and sleep with her, so is he able to adapt to his surroundings, or could Brussels be a better fit for his social personality?
