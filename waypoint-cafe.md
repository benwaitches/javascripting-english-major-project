## Waypoint Cafe

Today, internet cafes are becoming irrelevant. Many people with smartphones or laptops have their own wifi or unlimited data, and places like Starbucks and McDonald’s increasingly offer free wifi. Owners of shops like these often times must alter business models to survive, especially as many other internet cafes die off.

The [Waypoint Cafe](https://www.waypointcafenyc.com) transcends the style of the internet cafe, and calls itself an “eSports Internet Cafe.”[^1] With 30 PCs to rent, the cafe caters towards groups of friends who want to play video games together in a group setting.[^1]

Generally, Julius would almost never have a reason to use an Internet cafe while he lives in New York City. Throughout the rest of the novel, Julius does not visit shops of that nature again. Additionally, Julius would likely never show interest in video games, especially in a public setting. Considering the way he assumes that Farouq will just be an unintelligent employee, he would have nothing but contempt for someone who has devoted so much of their time to playing video games in a mundane environment such as a cafe like this.

Given the rarity of Julius’ experience with internet cafes, he would never have an experience like the one he shares with Farouq. While it may not be necessary given Julius’ experience living in New York City, he would not receive the awakening about the intellect of the people in a city like he does in Brussels after meeting Farouq.
